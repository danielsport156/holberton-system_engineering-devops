# Shell 0x02

in this project I had to create a file using emacs and inside the file type "#!/bin/basgh". On the next line I had to write "Hellow, World\n" after the "printf" command so that when I run the file after saving it, it would print the text "Hello, World". Once I finished I had to upload it to my "git repository".
