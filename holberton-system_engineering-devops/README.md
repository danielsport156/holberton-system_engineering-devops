# Project 5

In this project I had to create another repository using "Github". Then through my terminal I had to "git add", "git commit -m "text" and "git push" the repository after I have had created a directory with the name "holberton-system_engineering-devops" and the file "README.md" using the commands displayed in the "git repository".
